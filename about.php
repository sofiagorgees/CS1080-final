                <p>Would you like to be apart of Book Worms - Book Club? It's easy! Every two weeks we take responses from our form to pick a book. Each member then reads the book on their own and we meet 2 weeks after the choice is released to discuss the book. Meetings are very low stakes. Feel free to attend even if you haven't read the book and/or just to listen in on the discussion. We are super welcoming and we love new members, all are welcome! Book Worms is not a high commitment club by any means but rather a space place for discussion. This is a judement free zone so don't be shy to share your opinions.

                <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
                <p>Books Worms was founded in 2023. We began as a small local book club but through our awesome website more members joined. Today we are a welcoming and friendly book club where book lovers can unite for engaging conversations on works of literature. Our founder came from a low income neighboorhood and was the first genration in her family to go to school. She graduated from University of Vermont with a major in classics a masters in english. After her education she worked for the New Yorker as a featured journalist on literature. After many years with them she decided to move on a create a book club for lovers of prose to come together a share ideas and thoughts on great literature.
