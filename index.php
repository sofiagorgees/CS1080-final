                <p class="homeText1">Play It As It Lays: "A ruthless dissection of American life in the late 1960s, Play It as It Lays captures the mood of an entire generation, the ennui of contemporary society reflected in spare prose that blisters and haunts the reader. Set in a place beyond good and evil - literally in Hollywood, Las Vegas, and the barren wastes of the Mojave Desert, but figuratively in the landscape of an arid soul - it remains more than three decades after its original publication a profoundly disturbing novel, riveting in its exploration of a woman and a society in crisis and stunning in the still-startling intensity of its prose."

                This novel was chosen from the many recommendations by our members because of its contemporary themes. We have not yet read a book by Joan Didion so we decided that it was about time! We will be meeting on December 5th to discuss and dissect this amazing novel. Books Worms encourages annotations and thought provoking questions to share with the club, so if you feel so inclined don't be shy about bringing those with you!

                <p class="homeText2">Here lies a light biography on Joan Didion if you want to learn more about the great writer who produced Play it By it Lays and many other great pieces of work!
                Joan Didion is an author we admire because of her invaluable contributions to literary society with her nonfiction and fiction works. Bookworms loves feminist literarture and Didion's work is a grand contribution to this with her works dissecting what it means to be a woman in society and the excpectations that are associated with that.    
                "1934&#45;2021 Joan Didion was a journalist, novelist, memoirist, essayist, and screenwriter who wrote some of the sharpest and most evocative analyses of culture, politics, literature, family, and loss. She won the National Book Award in 2005 for The Year of Magical Thinking."

                <p class="homeText3">So you like reading? Awesome! But why should you consider joining a book club. Maybe you think that you already love reading and there is no point in fixing what ain't broken. But to the contrary there are many reasons why joining a book club will amplify your enjoyment of reading. Book clubs are very intellectually stimulating. There is more enjoyment in reading knowing that you will have peers to discuss the book with and share your own opinions about. The only thing as fun about reading a book is knowing that you can have a juicy debrief with your fellow book worms about it!
                Furthermore, book clubs can help you be more consistent with your reading. You are less likely to fall into a reading slump if you have a date in which you have to have the book read by. In other words book clubs are good for incentivizing yourself to actually finish a book. 
                Finally, book clubs are an amazing way to meet new people and find community. What is a better way to make friends then a club of people who all value the same thing as you, reading a good book!
